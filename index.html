                <p>Vidyashilp has achieved several laurels in Sports over the years. Our teams take part in around 40 - 50 Inter-School tournaments every academic year. Inter-School competitions are conducted in the school in almost all games. In addition, an annual Sports Day is hosted at school which resembles a ‘Mini Olympics’.

Vidyashilp Academy follows a unique sports program that sets two activities for Phase-I students per day and one sport activity for Phase 2 students per day.

An exceptionally large number of National Level Athletes thrive because the school is one of the few which considers sports as an integral part of the curriculum and class activities are managed so as to give athletes the opportunity to attend tournaments.

The program’s mandate is to enhance general health condition and basic physical fitness of every student, to contribute towards overall personality development, to develop life skills and to provide a platform for exposure and to help excel in each sport.</p>

He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br>  </p>
